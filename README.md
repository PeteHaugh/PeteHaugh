### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Pete and I'm a software engineer with a design engineering background. I enjoy taking on challenges, learning and delivering exciting projects. I also enjoy playing music and drinking coffee as you may be able to tell by the content of my portfolio site.

I am confident working with Javascript (ES6+), Typescript, SQL and Python as well as a large number of libraries, frameworks and APIs such as React, Express, node.js, Flask and more...

Currently, I'm trying to deepen my knowledge of React frameworks and learn a bit of Golang.

Please feel free to check out my [website](https://www.petehaugh.co.uk/) where you should find links to my most well maintained projects.
